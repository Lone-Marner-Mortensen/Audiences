The project is called Audience and contains 2 main classes:

1. A class called Members containing the source code.
2. A class called TestMembers containing unit tests.

In order to see the project and run the unit tests, you should have JDK, SBT,
Scala and an IDE installed. The best IDE for showing the project is IntelliJ.
